# Contributing Guide

InitialState<nolink />.NET is a part-time effort from a small team, so contributions are welcome!

## Dependencies
InitialState<nolink />.NET was built using Visual Studio 2017 and the .NET Framework 4.6.2.  It does not have any dependencies outside of the .NET Framework.


## Contributing/Submitting Changes
*	Create a fork from the latest dev branch and name it what you intend to do.
    * Branch names should start with:
        * topic/
        * feature/
        * bugfix/
    * Use one branch per feature/bugfix.
    * Words in the branch name should be hyphen (-) delimited.
    * Example:
        ```
        $ git remote update && git fetch
        $ git checkout -b topic/speed-improvements origin/dev
        ```
* Make your changes.
    * Test your changes work locally.
* Commit your changes.
    * Each commit should be as limited in scope as possible.
    * Ensure your commit messages are concise and explain “why” instead of “what”. 
* Submit a pull request.
    * Make sure your PR is against the develop branch.

Your pull request will serve as a code review. All submissions, including those by project members, require review.
